AsemblyARM-Ahorcado

This is a game I created as part of a final Practical Work submission for my Bachelor's degree in Systems. It is programmed in ARM Assembly. If you wish to run it, you should:

Install a virtual machine or emulator that supports ARM Assembly, such as:

QEMU
ARM Development Studio
Once installed, execute the file named 'TP_Final_Orga_7
